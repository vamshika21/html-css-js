                <p>Painters have used canvas to express their creativity for generations. It is still the preferred
                    painting surface for novices and professionals alike. This is particularly for acrylic painting.
                    Canvas is a flexible painting surface that is available in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and forms
                    to fit any requirement or budget. It has a wide range that may be used for everything from little
                    paintings to big, sprawling compositions.However, the two primary reasons why canvas is such a
                    popular
                    painting surface are how amazing it
                    feels beneath the brush and how long it lasts.Canvas is also lighter and easier to move than the
                    formerly used wood surfaces.</p>

                <p>In the ancient Sanskrit language of Hinduism and Buddhism, mandala means “circle.” Traditionally, a
                    mandala is a geometric design or pattern that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly
                    worlds. “It’s all about finding peace in the symmetry of the design and of the universe,” says
                    artist Saudamini Madra.Artist and math professor Fernanda Bonafini began making mandalas just for
                    the joy of it. “In the
                    process of drawing mandala artwork, you feel much calmer and more peaceful and your breathing and
                    heartbeat slow down. The sensation in your mind and body and their connection, is very good,”
                    Bonafini says. </p>

                <p>Doodling refers to drawing, sketching, or scribbling idly, while a person's attention is otherwise
                    occupied. They are basic sketches that may have concrete relevance for representation or can be
                    abstract shapes.
                    Typically, these hand-drawn forms are a product of anger, exhaustion, and stress. Some individuals
                    become restless during a meeting, and they dislike doing nothing, and they start doodling to ease
                    their boredom.
                    It may seem very disrespectful to start doodling at a meeting, but as per scientific research,
                    doodling while listening to someone feeding you data can help you better recall the details. The
                    doodle art form also helps you with many other things like;</p>
